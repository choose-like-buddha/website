There's a moment in every hard thing where quitting feels like the only sane option. The project that won't come together. The goal that feels impossibly far. The effort that nobody seems to notice.

## The Mindful Approach

Wanting to give up isn't failure — it's information. The question is what to do with it.

- **Distinguish exhaustion from clarity.** Sometimes "I want to quit" means "I need rest." Other times it means "This isn't right for me." They feel similar but lead to very different choices.
- **Zoom out.** Remember why you started. Not with forced motivation — with honest reflection. Does the original reason still hold?
- **Lower the bar, temporarily.** Instead of quitting entirely, ask: "What's the smallest version of this I can keep doing?" Momentum, even tiny, keeps the door open.

## A Practice for Today

If you're close to giving up on something, commit to just one more day. Not forever — just today. Tomorrow, you can decide again. Often, that one day is enough to shift something.
