A new job. A relationship ending. A move to a different city. Even positive change can feel threatening, because our minds are wired to prefer the familiar.

## The Mindful Approach

Fear of change isn't something to overcome — it's something to understand.

- **Notice what you're clinging to.** Is it comfort? Identity? A story about how things should be? Naming the attachment loosens its grip.
- **Remember impermanence.** Everything changes whether we want it to or not. Resisting change doesn't prevent it — it only adds suffering to the transition.
- **Take the smallest step.** You don't need to leap. One small action in the direction of change builds courage gradually.

## A Practice for Today

Think of one change you've been avoiding. Instead of deciding whether to make it, simply sit with the fear it brings. Don't push it away. Don't analyze it. Just let it be there, and notice that you're okay even with the fear present. That's where courage begins.
