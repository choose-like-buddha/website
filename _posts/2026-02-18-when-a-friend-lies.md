Finding out a friend lied to you is disorienting. Trust, once broken, changes how we see the whole relationship. The pain is real — but so is the choice of what to do next.

## The Mindful Approach

Before confronting or withdrawing, sit with what you feel. Name it — hurt, betrayal, confusion, sadness.

- **Separate the act from the person.** People lie for many reasons — fear, shame, protection. Understanding why doesn't excuse it, but it opens a door to compassion.
- **Ask yourself what you need.** Is it an apology? An explanation? Space? Knowing your need helps you communicate clearly.
- **Speak from honesty.** If you want truth from others, lead with it yourself. Say what you feel without blame.

## A Practice for Today

Think of a time you weren't fully honest with someone. Not to excuse your friend, but to remember that people are complicated — including you. From that place of shared humanity, the right response often becomes clearer.
