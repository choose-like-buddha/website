A dismissive comment in a meeting. Credit taken for your idea. An unfair decision from above. Anger at work is natural — but acting on it without awareness can make things worse.

## The Mindful Approach

Anger carries energy. The question is whether you direct it or let it direct you.

- **Acknowledge it quietly.** You don't need to announce your anger. Just notice it: "I'm angry right now."
- **Delay your response.** If you can, wait before replying to that email or speaking up. Even ten minutes changes your perspective.
- **Look beneath the anger.** Often it masks something deeper — feeling undervalued, unheard, or disrespected. Address the root, not just the surface.

## A Practice for Today

The next time frustration rises at work, place your hand flat on your desk. Feel the surface. That small physical anchor can interrupt the autopilot reaction and give you just enough space to choose a wiser response.
