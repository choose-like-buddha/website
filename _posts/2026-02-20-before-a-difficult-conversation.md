We rehearse difficult conversations in our heads — imagining responses, planning counterarguments. But when the moment arrives, none of that usually helps. What helps is presence.

## The Mindful Approach

Preparation isn't about having the perfect script. It's about showing up with the right intention.

- **Clarify your purpose.** What do you actually want from this conversation? Resolution? Understanding? To be heard? Know this before you begin.
- **Let go of the outcome.** You can control what you say, not how it's received. Releasing that expectation frees you to be genuine.
- **Breathe before you speak.** Not as a technique — as a reminder that this moment matters and deserves your full attention.

## A Practice for Today

Before your next difficult conversation, take sixty seconds alone. Close your eyes. Breathe slowly. Set one simple intention — perhaps "I will listen fully" or "I will speak honestly." Then enter the conversation carrying that intention like a quiet anchor.
