Overwhelm happens when our mind tries to hold everything at once — every task, every worry, every possibility. It's not a sign of weakness. It's a sign you care about a lot of things.

## The Mindful Approach

Instead of pushing through or shutting down, try narrowing your focus to just this moment.

- **Stop the list-making.** Your mind will try to solve everything at once. Let it rest.
- **Feel your feet on the ground.** Literally. This pulls you out of your head and into your body.
- **Choose one thing.** Not the most urgent, not the most important — just one thing you can do right now.

## A Practice for Today

Set a timer for five minutes. Do one small task with your full attention. When the timer ends, notice how you feel. Overwhelm shrinks when we stop trying to carry everything simultaneously.

One step is always possible. Start there.
