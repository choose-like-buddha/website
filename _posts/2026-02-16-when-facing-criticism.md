Criticism can feel like a personal attack. Our instinct is to defend, deflect, or shut down. But what if we could meet it differently?

## The Mindful Approach

When someone criticizes you, notice the first sensation in your body — the tightness in your chest, the heat in your face. That's your cue to pause.

Before responding, ask yourself:

- **Is there truth here?** Even harsh words sometimes carry a useful insight.
- **Is this about me, or about them?** Sometimes criticism reflects the other person's frustration, not your failure.
- **What would kindness look like right now?** Both toward yourself and toward the person speaking.

## A Practice for Today

The next time you receive criticism — even something small — try waiting three breaths before responding. In those breaths, let the initial reaction pass. Then choose your response with clarity, not impulse.

Not every criticism deserves agreement. But every moment deserves awareness.
