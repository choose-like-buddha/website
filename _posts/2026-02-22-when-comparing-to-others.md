title: "When Comparing to Others?"

description: "Comparison is a habit of the mind — but your path is not anyone else's to walk."

Someone gets the promotion. A friend buys a house. A stranger on the internet seems to have it all figured out. Comparison is effortless — and quietly destructive.

## The Mindful Approach

You can't stop comparisons from arising, but you can change how you relate to them.

- **Catch the moment it starts.** Comparison often hides behind other feelings — jealousy, inadequacy, frustration. Notice the trigger.
- **Question the story.** You're comparing your full, complicated inner life to someone else's surface. That's never a fair comparison.
- **Return to your own path.** Ask: "What matters to me?" Not what should matter, or what others value — what genuinely matters to you.

## A Practice for Today

The next time you catch yourself comparing, pause and name three things about your own life that you chose intentionally. They don't have to be big — a habit you built, a relationship you nurtured, a skill you developed. Comparison fades when you reconnect with your own choices.
