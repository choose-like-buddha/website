Someone cuts you off in traffic. A cashier snaps at you. A colleague dismisses your idea without listening. Rudeness lands like a small shock — and our instinct is to send it right back.

## The Mindful Approach

You didn't choose to receive rudeness. But you always choose what to do with it.

- **Don't absorb it.** Rudeness is like a gift you don't have to accept. You can acknowledge it happened without letting it define your mood.
- **Consider the source.** People who are rude are almost always dealing with their own pain — stress, frustration, fear. This isn't an excuse, but it's context.
- **Respond, or don't.** Sometimes the most powerful response is none at all. Other times, a calm and direct reply is what's needed. Choose based on the situation, not on your adrenaline.

## A Practice for Today

Think of the last time someone was rude to you. Now imagine them in a moment of struggle — tired, worried, afraid. This doesn't make their behavior okay. But it reminds you that meeting rudeness with compassion protects your peace more than any comeback ever could.
